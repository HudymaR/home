		<h2 class = "headings"> Introduction </h2>
		<p> Everything we know today will eventually come to an end including the universe. There are 3 main theories about the end. The Big Freeze&sbquo; Big Crunch and&sbquo; Big Rip. Recently, another scenario has been discovered. The Big Slurp, more commonly known as vacuum decay </p>

		<h2 id="TheBigFreeze"> The Big Freeze </h2>
		<h3> What is it? </h3>
		<p> The Big Freeze&sbquo; also known as The Big Chill or Heat Death is simply the idea that the universe will continue to expand until all matter is too far to interact with each other. Stars will die&sbquo; galaxies cease to exist. Eventually&sbquo; black holes will evaporate until nothing is left.  </p>
                <h3> Who discovered it? </h3>
		<p> Many scientists contributed for this theory to form. Some include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble"> Edwin Hubble</a>&sbquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"> Albert Einstein </a> and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking"> Stephen Hawking. </a> </p>
		<h2 id="TheBigCrunch"> The Big Crunch </h2>
		<h3> What is it? </h3>
		<p> The Big Crunch is a theory that the universe will eventually slow its expansion and reach a halt. In this scenario&sbquo; the universe will retract in on itself and collapse. Scientists say the <a href = "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10777957/Scientists-predict-universe-start-shrinking-remarkably-soon.html"> Big Crunch</a> is most likely the ending we&rsquo;re headed towards.  </p>
		<h3> Big Bounce </h3>
		<p> Another theory that comes with the Big Crunch is the Big Bounce. The universe constantly recycles itself by expanding and contracting. It's a constant loop of the Big Crunch and the Big Bang. This raises many questions&sbquo; if this truly is the fate of our universe how was the first universe created and why? How many universe&rsquo;s were before ours? How many more will there be? </p>
		<h3> Who discovered the Big Crunch? </h3>
		<p> The Big Crunch is creditied to Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann. He is famous for a set of equations known as the &ldquo;Friedmann Equations&rdquo;. In this set of equations he proves that the universe&rsquo;s fate is determined by its density and that it can either expand or contract&sbquo; eventually leading to one of the hypothetical scenario&rsquo;s. </p>
		<h3> Who discovered the Big Bounce? </h3>
		<p> The Big Bounce was discovered by Abhay Ashtekar&sbquo; Tomasz Pawlowski&sbquo; and Parampreet Singh. </p>
		<h2 id="TheBigRip"> The Big Rip </h2>
		<h3> What is it? </h3>
		<p> The Big Rip explains that the universe&rsquo;s expansion will speed up and the force will become so strong it tears all matter apart. Luckily for us this won&rsquo;t happen for at least another 22 billion years&sbquo; however that isn&rsquo;t certain. </p>	
		<h3> Who discovered it? </h3>
		<p> Marcelo Disconzi takes credit for the modern model of the Big Rip </p>
		<h2 id="TheBigSlurp"> The Big Slurp (Vacuum Decay) </h2>
		<!--Don't forget to add special characters-->	
		<h3> What Is It? </h3> 
		<p> Vacuum Decay is one of the most terrifying yet intruging ends to our universe. Essentially&sbquo; a vacuum is a perfect area of space with nothing in it&sbquo; no particles or atoms. Nothing. However&sbquo; the universecan never truly be empty. One thing exists&sbquo; quantum energy fields that fluctuate&sbquo; they have always existed&sbquo; even before the beginning of the universe. They may have been the cause of the Big Bang. When these energy fields are at a low energy state&sbquo; they're in a true vacuum. The Higgs Field is a quantum energy field responsible for giving particles mass&sbquo; it&rsquo;s the reason light particles have no mass. In order for the universe to be stable and in a true vacuum&sbquo; the energy fields have to be in their true state&sbquo; and this seems to be the case. Except&sbquo; the Higgs Field may be in a false vacuum&sbquo; it&rsquo;s stuck at a certain level of energy where it doesn't want to be. Eventually&sbquo; it will break out of its false vacuum and into its true vacuum. When this happens&sbquo; a bubble of the true vacuum with different laws of physics will cosume the universe. At the end&sbquo; the universe will be in its true state with different forces&sbquo; particles and laws of physics.  </p>
